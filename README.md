##  Introduction
* Master Riordan Taekwon-do club page is for Master Riordan taekwon-do club members but also for people who looking for to become a member. 
* The page is about the club, it's health benefits, training times, links to social media and includes a contact form for inquieries or messages. 
* The gallery is for pictures to inspire, show club training and activities.

## Design


### Colour scheme

* My colour scheme is inspired by Taekwondo belt colours:

White Belt
Signifies innocence, as that of the beginning student who has no previous knowledge of Taekwondo.

Blue Belt
Signifies the Heaven towards which the plant matures into a towering tree as training in Taekwondo progresses. 

Red Belt
Signifies Danger, cautioning the student to exercise control and warning the opponent to stay away.

Black Belt
Opposite of white, therefore signifying the maturity and proficiency in Taekwondo, also indicates the wearerâ€™s imperviousness to darkness and fear.

* "BLACK BELT IS A WHITE BELT WHO NEVER QUIT."

* white  #fafafa
* Cover text background colour, h2 heading and footer: blue  rgba(52, 80, 141)
* Contact button: red  #f33131
* Main text: black  #252525

As Taekwondo originates from Korea their flag colours are white, black, red and blue as well.

White backround symbolizing Korean people who was known as people who wearing white clothes. 

It also means symbolizing brighness, purity and peace.

## Bugs

While i was working with my gitpod workspace Readme.md file was frozen, it would only open for a split second. I tried opening it, closing it and restarting my laptop but nothing worked.

I needed to open a new workspace to continue working.
