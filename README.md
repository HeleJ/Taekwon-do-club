##  Introduction

## Design


### Colour scheme

* My colour scheme is inspired by Taekwondo belt colours:

White Belt
Signifies innocence, as that of the beginning student who has no previous knowledge of Taekwondo.

Blue Belt
Signifies the Heaven towards which the plant matures into a towering tree as training in Taekwondo progresses. 

Red Belt
Signifies Danger, cautioning the student to exercise control and warning the opponent to stay away.

Black Belt
Opposite of white, therefore signifying the maturity and proficiency in Taekwondo, also indicates the wearerâ€™s imperviousness to darkness and fear.

* "BLACK BELT IS A WHITE BELT WHO NEVER QUIT."

* white  #fafafa
* blue  rgba(52, 80, 141)
* red  #f33131
* black  #252525
